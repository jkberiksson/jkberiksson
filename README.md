# Hi there, I'm Jakob ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate web developer based in Kalmar, Sweden (though Iâ€™m often on the move!). With three years of university education behind me, I've developed a strong preference for frontend development, working primarily with technologies like **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Framer Motion**. Iâ€™m also experienced in backend development, working with **Node.js**, **Express**, **MongoDB**, and **Mongoose**.

## Skills
